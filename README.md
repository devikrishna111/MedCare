### Project Description
A mobile and web application designed to help users manage their medication schedules, ensuring timely and accurate medication intake.
Key Features
------------------
*Personalized medication tracking
*Customizable reminder notifications
*Dosage and schedule management
*Medication visualization


### The Problem statement
The project aims to solve the ridiculous problem of people forgetting to take their medications, despite living in an era of smart devices, reminders, and alarms that could easily prevent such forgetfulness.
Key ridiculous aspects:
-------------------------
*Humans spend millions developing complex medical technologies
*Yet can't remember to take a simple pill at the right time
*People often have multiple medications with different schedules
*Resulting in missed doses, health complications, and unnecessary doctor visits

### The Solution
Basically, we're solving human unreliability with an app that's part health assistant.
